                    <h4>15th Sept</h4>
                    <p class="blogtext">I decided to treat myself to a private workshop with a professional portrait photographer so I remembered a photographer who had come to the club last year to show his work, and I remember being very impressed with his images. <a href="http://www.modelmayhem.com/portfolio/1850165/viewall#/27377104" >Michael Hayes</a> was his name and he stuck in my memory because I found his work to be different and imaginative compared to many portrait photographers I had seen in the past. </p>
                    
                    <p class="blogtext">So I gave him a shout and we arranged a date, and time out at his livingroom studio where he also organised a very beautiful model from South Africa, Keara Lydon who lived in Malahide. We did 90 mins theory followed by 90 mins practical with a variety of different lighting equipment and setups. A lot to take in but a thoroughly enjoyable afternoon. These are just 2 of the many shots I took on the day. </p>

                    <p class="blogtext">Not usually a fan of taking pictures with my Phone (Samsung S5) but I have to admit it performs pretty well outdoors in half decent light. Was down around Clontarf today and took these with it and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with the results. A quick run through Lightroom to convert to Mono is all thats done with them.</p>

                    <h4>30th August</h4>
                    <p class="blogtext">I have been planning a themed shot for a month or so now. The theme I wanted to do was Marilyn Manson/Vampire/Gothic Horror. Got my model (who I have worked with before and found her to be brilliant, Laura Cunningham is her name). I then sourced a Make Up Artist I had not worked with before. Between us we got the clothes, make up, props and I booked a studio for 3 hours. We all turned up at the studio only to discover that we had been let down as neither the owner nor his assistant were there to let us in nor were they answering their phones </p>
                    
                    <p class="blogtext">I googled a few other places in a panic and eventually found somewhere close by that was free, so we packed up and headed over there. I had bought stick on Fangs that didn't stick on. Bought special FX contact lenses that we never got round to using on the day and bought fake blood which upon examination appeared as if it may stain skin never mind clothes. So I decided to do it all in Photoshop. Heres the image after editing. Move your mouse over it to see how it looked straight out of camera.</p>

                    <p class="blogtext">Went to Rosses Point, Co Sligo for the weekend and stayed in the Yeats hotel. The scenery is just spectacular and the weather as you can see was very very kind. I would thoroughly recommend the hotel. Clean, Comfortable with great views, nice pool and friendly staff.</p>

Great food in Austies, which is a 5 minute walk from the Hotel, and a couple of pints in a cool pub called Harrys, and all only a 2 and a half hours drive from Dublin. Stopped off on the way home to have a close look at the sculpture "The Chieftain", something I have wanted to do for a long time.  </p>

                     <h4>7th August</h4>
                    <p class="blogtext">I have been practising and trying to perfect the art of Macro photography. It is extremely difficult because the slightest breeze is your enemy. When you are as close to insects on a plant as I am here they move in and out of focus. So you are trying to use a high sutter speed to freeze the motion whilst using a good Depth of Field to get as much of the subject in focus as you can. (Macro photography by its nature always results in shallow depth of field) so you have to use a high ISO  which then brings noise into the equation.  </p>
                    
                    <div class="f1_container">
                        <div class="f1_card" class="shadow">
                            <div class="front face">
                                <img src="images/blog/beesharp.jpg"/>
                            </div>
                            <div class="back center">

                    </div>
                    
                    <p class="blogtext">Then you also have the problem of the dog cocking his leg on the plant and insect you are trying to photograph. And finally you have the noise my knees make when I try to stand up again. You need good light for this, so a pretty sunny day is best as it allows you to keep the ISO down somewhat. A monopod or tripod can help but can also be a nuisance if the insects are flitting from plant to plant. Trial and error along with a lot of patience is the name of the game.</p>
