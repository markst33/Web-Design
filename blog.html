                    <p class="blogtext">Went out to Howth for a walk and something to eat. Brought bread with us for the kids to feed the Gulls. When you are up close to them you realise just how big these birds are.</p>

                    <p class="blogtext">The National Botanic Gardens is well worth a visit, even if you are not interested in photographing anything. Peaceful, beautiful and colourful, it is an oasis of calm in the heart of the city. Failte Ireland recently revealed it to be the 2nd most popular Free tourist destination in the country, coming in behind the National Gallery of Ireland. </p>
                    <p class="blogtext">However if you are interested in photography then it is the perfect place to try out flower and plant photography, nature photography (with the birds and squirrels that call here home) or Macro photography as I did on my recent trip here. </p>

                    <p class="blogtext">If you have a tripod, bring it with you. However if like me you have the kids in tow then you will have to ramp up your ISO in order to get a shutter speed fast enough to freeze the motion of flowers in the breeze of the movement of insects</p>
